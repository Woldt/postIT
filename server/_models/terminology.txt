MongoDB terminology:

Database: is a physical container for collections.
          Each dtabase gets its own set of files on the file system.
          A single Mongo DB server typically has multiple databases

Collections (table): is a groupe of MongoDB documents.
                    A collection exists within a single database.
                    Colletion do not enforce a schema. Documents within a
                    collection can have different fields.
                    TYPICALLY; all documents in a collection are of similar or related purpose.

Document (tuple): A document is a set of key-value pairs.
                              Documents have dynamic schema.

                              Dynamic schema means that documents in the same collection
                              do not need to have the same set of fields or structure,
                              and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data.



MongoDB               VS       RDBMS (e.x. MySQL):
Database              |       Database
Collection            |       Table
Document              |       Tuple / row
Field                 |       Column
Embedded Documents    |       Table Join
Primary Key           |       Primary key


# IN MongoDB
Primary Key  --> Default key _id provided by mongodb itself.
